# Project 2 - FastMCP Server: Testing, Network, Authentication & Remote Deployment

A comprehensive guide to building a production-ready Model Context Protocol (MCP) server with advanced features including unit testing, transport protocols, authentication mechanisms, and remote server deployment.

## Description

Project 2 extends the basic Confluence MCP server from Project 1 by adding enterprise-grade features essential for production deployments. This project focuses on code quality through comprehensive testing, secure communication protocols, robust authentication systems, and scalable remote deployment strategies.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Implement comprehensive unit testing for MCP servers using pytest
- Understand and implement different transport protocols for MCP communication
- Integrate authentication mechanisms for secure API access
- Deploy MCP servers to remote environments with proper configuration
- Learn best practices for production-ready MCP server development

## Features

### üß™ Unit Testing

- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Complete test coverage for all MCP tools and client operations
- **Mock Testing**: Proper mocking of external API calls for isolated testing
- **Fixture Management**: Reusable test fixtures for consistent test environments
- **Coverage Reporting**: Automated coverage tracking and reporting
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing

### üåê Transport Protocols

- **StdIO**: Standard I/O for local client/server communication
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: Streaming updates for long-running operations
- **Streamable HTTP**:

### üîê Authentication & Security

- **Multiple Auth Methods**: Support for API tokens, OAuth 2.0, and JWT
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against API abuse and DoS attacks
- **CORS Configuration**: Secure cross-origin resource sharing
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive request validation and sanitization
- **Audit Logging**: Security event logging and monitoring

### üöÄ Remote Server Deployment

- **Container Support**: Docker containerization for consistent deployments
- **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy to AWS, GCP, Azure, or other cloud providers
- **Environment Management**: Proper configuration management for different environments
- **Health Checks**: Endpoint monitoring and health verification

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Project 1 (Basic Confluence MCP Server)
- Python 3.10+
- Docker (for containerization)
- Cloud provider account (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.) for remote deployment
- Confluence Cloud instance with API access

## Implementation Guide

### Phase 1: Unit Testing Foundation

#### 1.1 Enhanced Test Configuration

```python
# tests/conftest.py - Enhanced with more fixtures and configuration
```

#### 1.2 Comprehensive Client Testing

- Mock Confluence API responses
- Test error handling and retry logic
- Validate authentication flows
- Test rate limiting behavior

#### 1.3 Tool Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for each MCP tool
- Integration tests for tool combinations
- Performance testing for large operations
- Security testing for input validation

### Phase 2: Transport Protocol Implementation

#### 2.1 Standard I/O

- RESTful endpoint design
- Request/response validation
- Error handling and status codes
- Content negotiation

#### 2.2 Server-Sent Events (SSE)

- Streaming updates for long operations
- Event formatting and client handling
- Connection lifecycle management
- Fallback mechanisms

#### 2.3 Streamable HTTP

### Phase 3: Authentication & Security

#### 3.1 Multi-Auth Support

```python
# confluence/auth.py - Authentication handler implementation
```

#### 3.2 Security Enhancements

- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting implementation
- CORS configuration
- Security headers and middleware

#### 3.3 Audit and Monitoring

- Security event logging
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting
- Usage analytics

### Phase 4: Remote Deployment

#### 4.1 Containerization

```dockerfile
# deployment/Dockerfile - Production-ready container
```

#### 4.2 Cloud Deployment Options

**Google Cloud Platform:**

- Cloud Run for serverless container deployment
- Cloud Load Balancing for traffic management
- Cloud Monitoring for observability
- Cloud IAM for authentication
