# MCP: Building AI-Native Applications with Model Context Protocol

## What is MCP? (0:00 - 5:00)

MCP stands for Model Context Protocol. It's a standardized way for AI models to communicate with various tools and services. Think of it like a universal USB connector for AI applications - one standard that works regardless of which AI model or tools you're using.

Before MCP, developers had to create custom integrations for each tool they wanted their AI to access. This was inefficient and complex. MCP solves this by providing a common language for all these tools.

## Why MCP Matters (5:00 - 10:00)

When you're building AI applications, you often want your agent to:
- Access data from different sources
- Connect to various services (like GitHub, Jira, etc.)
- Perform actions beyond just generating text

Without MCP, each integration requires:
- Learning different APIs
- Managing different authentication methods
- Writing custom code for each service

MCP provides:
- **One standard protocol** - learn once, use everywhere
- **Pre-built integrations** - connect to services quickly
- **Vendor-agnostic flexibility** - switch AI models without rewriting integrations
- **Better security** - standardized authentication

## How MCP Works (10:00 - 15:00)

MCP uses a client-server architecture:

- **MCP Hosts**: Programs like VS Code, Cursor, or Claude Desktop that want to access tools
- **MCP Clients**: The components that connect to MCP servers
- **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs that expose specific capabilities (like accessing Jira, GitHub, etc.)

MCP supports two main ways of communicating:

1. **Standard I/O transport**:
   - Uses standard input/output for communication
   - Ideal for local tools running on your computer

2. **HTTP with Server-Sent Events (SSE)**:
   - Uses HTTP for network communication
   - Good for remote services

All communication uses JSON-RPC 2.0 for exchanging messages.

## Setting Up MCP Servers (15:00 - 25:00)

Setting up MCP servers is relatively simple:

1. **Choose an MCP server**: Many pre-built servers are available for common tools
2. **Install dependencies**: Most servers require Node.js
3. **Configure the server**: Often just requires adding an API key
4. **Connect to your AI environment**: Like Cursor or VS Code

Example: Adding an MCP server in Cursor:
1. Open Cursor settings
2. Go to the MCP section
3. Click "Add new Global MCP server"
4. Add the server configuration

For Windows users, commands typically need to start with `command SLC` before the actual command.

## Building a Simple MCP Server (25:00 - 35:00)

Let's create a basic MCP server that can handle structured data. We'll use Python with FastAPI:

```python
# Simple MCP server example
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional
import os
from openai import OpenAI

app = FastAPI()
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

# Basic MCP data models
class ContextBlock(BaseModel):
    id: str
    type: str
    data: Any = None

class Message(BaseModel):
    role: str
    content: str
    context: Optional[List[ContextBlock]] = None

@app.post("/generate")
async def generate(request: dict):
    # Process the request
    messages = request["messages"]
    formatted_messages = []
    
    for message in messages:
        # Format the message for the model
        formatted_message = {
            "role": message["role"],
            "content": message["content"]
        }
        
        # Handle any context blocks
        if "context" in message and message["context"]:
            # Add context to the message
            context_text = "\n\nContext:\n"
            for block in message["context"]:
                context_text += f"- {block['id']}: {block['data']}\n"
            formatted_message["content"] += context_text
        
        formatted_messages.append(formatted_message)
    
    # Call the AI model
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=formatted_messages
    )
    
    # Return the response
    return {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": response.choices[0].message.content
    }
```

This simple server:
1. Accepts messages with context blocks
2. Formats them for the AI model
3. Returns the model's response

## Using MCP in Practice (35:00 - 45:00)

Here's an example of using an MCP client to send a request with structured data:

```python
# Example client usage
import requests

# Define context blocks
context = [
    {
        "id": "user_data",
        "type": "application/json",
        "data": {
            "users": [
                {"name": "Alice", "role": "Engineer"},
                {"name": "Bob", "role": "Designer"}
            ]
        }
    }
]

# Create the request
request = {
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Who are our team members?",
            "context": context
        }
    ]
}

# Send to MCP server
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/generate",
    json=request
)

print(response.json())
```

## Popular MCP Servers (45:00 - 50:00)

Some useful MCP servers you can try:

1. **Web Scraping**: Allows your AI to fetch and analyze web content
2. **GitHub**: Access repositories, issues, and PRs
3. **Jira/Confluence**: Work with tickets and documentation
4. **Database Access**: Query SQL databases
5. **File System**: Access and modify local files
6. **Sequential Thinking**: Helps models solve problems step-by-step

## Best Practices (50:00 - 55:00)

When working with MCP:

1. **Security**: Be careful with API keys and access controls
2. **Performance**: Consider caching for frequently accessed data
3. **Error Handling**: Implement proper fallbacks when services are unavailable
4. **Documentation**: Document which context types your server supports
5. **Testing**: Test with different AI models to ensure compatibility

## Conclusion (55:00 - 60:00)

MCP represents a significant advancement in how we build AI applications:

- It standardizes interactions between AI models and external tools
- It preserves the structure of data, making AI responses more accurate
- It allows for a modular approach to building AI capabilities
- It's vendor-agnostic, working with any AI model that supports the protocol

As the MCP ecosystem grows, we'll see more pre-built integrations and tools that make building powerful AI applications easier than ever.

The best way to learn is to start experimenting with existing MCP servers, then try building your own when you're ready to dive deeper.
