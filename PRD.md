# Product Requirements Document: AI Baby Tracker

**Date:** May 3, 2025  
**Product Owner:** [Your Name]  
**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

The AI Baby Tracker is a mobile application designed to help first-time parents track and understand their baby's development patterns. The app leverages artificial intelligence to provide insights and predictions about development milestones, sleep patterns, feeding schedules, and more. By combining user-friendly tracking tools with AI-powered analysis, the app aims to reduce anxiety and increase confidence for new parents navigating the challenges of caring for an infant.

## Problem Statement

First-time parents often experience anxiety and uncertainty when caring for their newborns. They struggle with:

1. Tracking essential care activities (feedings, sleep, diaper changes) in a consistent, organized manner
2. Understanding whether their baby's patterns are normal or concerning
3. Remembering important development milestones and when they typically occur
4. Making data-driven decisions about care routines
5. Getting personalized guidance without constantly consulting pediatricians or parenting books
6. Maintaining mental health while adapting to the stress of new parenthood

Current baby tracking apps lack intelligent insights and simply serve as digital logbooks. Parents need a solution that transforms tracked data into meaningful, personalized guidance.

## Target Audience

### Primary Users
- First-time parents with infants aged 0-24 months
- Typically 25-40 years old
- Smartphone-savvy and comfortable with technology
- Concerned about providing optimal care for their baby
- Value data-driven insights and evidence-based parenting approaches
- Often experience information overload from multiple sources

### Secondary Users
- Co-parents and caregivers (grandparents, nannies, daycare providers)
- Pediatricians and healthcare providers
- Experienced parents with newborns seeking more structured tracking

## User Research Insights

Based on interviews with 30 first-time parents:
- 85% expressed anxiety about whether their baby was developing normally
- 72% track baby activities on paper or basic apps but find the process cumbersome
- 91% would value predictions about upcoming development changes
- 78% feel overwhelmed by conflicting parenting advice
- 64% want easier ways to share baby data with partners and pediatricians

## Solution Overview

The AI Baby Tracker will combine intuitive tracking interfaces with powerful AI analysis to create a comprehensive baby care solution. The app will allow parents to:

1. Easily log and visualize baby care activities
2. Receive AI-generated insights about patterns and anomalies
3. Get personalized predictions about upcoming development milestones
4. Access evidence-based recommendations for optimizing care routines
5. Share data securely with co-parents and healthcare providers

The differentiating factor is the application of machine learning to transform simple tracking into personalized guidance, reducing anxiety and increasing confidence for new parents.
