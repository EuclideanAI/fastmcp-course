# Build Anything with MCP Agents… Here’s How
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/L94WBLL0KjY

00:00:00.160 let's talk about mCP or the model
00:00:02.919 context protocol this has been blowing
00:00:05.160 up recently a ton of people are covering
00:00:07.120 it especially on YouTube but
00:00:09.040 unfortunately most people talking about
00:00:10.920 this have no idea what it actually is
00:00:13.400 how it works and how to explain it in a
00:00:15.200 way where they're not going to confuse
00:00:16.560 the heck out of you so in today's video
00:00:18.600 I'm going to break down what it is in
00:00:20.359 very simple terms coming from someone
00:00:22.160 who is actually a developer and then I'm
00:00:24.320 going to show you how you can set it up
00:00:25.840 inside of cursor and start using it to
00:00:28.080 build some very interesting AI agents so
00:00:30.720 with that said let's get into it and
00:00:32.238 learn about the model context protocol
00:00:34.480 so in order for us to truly understand
00:00:36.399 mCP servers I want to make a comparison
00:00:38.680 to something that we might be more
00:00:39.879 familiar with which is a rest API now
00:00:42.600 even if you're not a developer don't
00:00:43.840 worry I'm going to explain what this is
00:00:45.719 but the point is that we have these
00:00:47.079 things called rest apis rest stands for
00:00:50.039 representational State transfer and
00:00:52.239 these apis are used typically for web
00:00:54.719 app communication they can be used for
00:00:56.600 other things as well but the example
00:00:58.320 you'll be most familiar with is a
00:01:00.239 standard web application now when we
00:01:02.320 have a web application we have something
00:01:03.960 like a client or a front end the front
00:01:06.439 end is what you interact with as the
00:01:08.240 user something like facebook.com or
00:01:10.799 instagram.com where you're actually you
00:01:12.479 know submitting a form or making a post
00:01:14.799 or viewing comments or something along
00:01:16.600 those lines now when you're using that
00:01:18.799 client behind the scenes what's
00:01:20.960 happening is it's sending these HTTP
00:01:23.600 request using something called a rest
00:01:26.040 API so we have this server the server is
00:01:29.079 secure it's being ran by some kind of
00:01:31.000 company and it has all of the data for
00:01:33.560 the web application so when you make a
00:01:35.560 new post for example you send an HTTP
00:01:38.640 post request to a particular URL on This
00:01:41.680 Server it then makes that new post
00:01:43.920 updates the database and then sends you
00:01:46.119 back all of that data to the client to
00:01:47.880 tell you hey this post was successful
00:01:50.000 same thing if you're fetching comments
00:01:51.640 or retrieving a profile or something
00:01:53.520 along those lines behind the scenes you
00:01:55.439 send this HTTP request using this API
00:01:58.759 and then you get the data back
00:02:00.360 now this is a communication protocol
00:02:02.399 it's standardized it's something that's
00:02:03.920 used probably tens of millions of times
00:02:06.399 across the internet and there are
00:02:07.920 literally billions of HTTP requests
00:02:10.038 being sent every single day now the
00:02:12.360 reason why we have this is to set a
00:02:14.440 standard a consistent way of doing
00:02:16.640 something one where all developers can
00:02:18.840 just follow this practice and we can
00:02:20.640 have all of these millions of apis that
00:02:22.800 work in the exact same way now that
00:02:24.959 leads us over to mCP servers and why
00:02:27.480 they were created and how these can help
00:02:29.480 you build really powerful agents and
00:02:32.000 speaking of gamechanging AI agents
00:02:34.239 today's sponsor samb NOA is pushing the
00:02:36.680 envelope with their open source deep
00:02:38.920 research agents and the fastest most
00:02:41.480 efficient AI inference solution powered
00:02:44.200 by reconfigurable data flow units or
00:02:46.519 rdus samb noa's Hardware stack delivers
00:02:49.519 10 times the performance of traditional
00:02:51.599 gpus this means you can run intricate
00:02:54.159 research queries and generate insights
00:02:56.159 in record time unlocking discoveries
00:02:58.480 that were previously just complet
00:02:59.840 completely out of reach and the best
00:03:01.599 part is that this is an open stack which
00:03:03.680 means you can bring your own models like
00:03:05.440 llama and deep seek and seamlessly
00:03:07.560 integrate them into the most powerful AI
00:03:09.599 research platform on the market with
00:03:11.840 three times faster processing than top
00:03:13.840 GPU providers Enterprises are not only
00:03:16.239 saving Millions but also gaining the
00:03:18.360 Competitive Edge by tapping into
00:03:20.120 realtime insights across scientific
00:03:22.319 research finance and Enterprise AI
00:03:25.440 imagine a leading biotech firm that
00:03:27.200 could use this deep research agent to
00:03:29.159 sift through terabytes of data and
00:03:31.319 clinical studies uncovering novel
00:03:33.480 biomarks that could expedite drug
00:03:35.400 Discovery with sova's deep research
00:03:37.560 agent these complex cross-domain queries
00:03:40.560 can be ran in real time something that
00:03:42.920 traditional GPU based systems simply
00:03:45.360 cannot match you can upgrade your AI
00:03:47.760 stack today by clicking the link in the
00:03:49.760 description and experiencing the future
00:03:51.840 of deep research with samb NOA so all of
00:03:54.720 that context brings us to the model
00:03:57.040 context protocol now this is very
00:03:59.400 similar to something like a rest API
00:04:02.159 this is just a standardized way for an
00:04:04.480 AI agent to communicate with a set of
00:04:06.560 tools So currently or kind of before
00:04:08.920 this video and before this model context
00:04:10.920 protocol came out we had all these
00:04:12.959 different tools and we know that AI
00:04:14.799 agents are really good when we give them
00:04:16.639 access to these various tools databases
00:04:19.560 Google Drive you know search features
00:04:21.880 whatever but all these tools were
00:04:23.560 implemented completely differently there
00:04:25.560 was no standardized protocol so it made
00:04:27.639 it very difficult for us to integrate 10
00:04:29.840 20 30 40 tools to our agent because it
00:04:32.520 required custom Integrations custom
00:04:34.600 coding and just a lot of complexity
00:04:36.720 because there was no standardized method
00:04:38.800 you can kind of think of it like this
00:04:40.600 imagine that you had 10 friends that
00:04:42.320 were all experts in different areas but
00:04:44.560 they all spoke a completely different
00:04:46.160 language Portuguese English Mandarin
00:04:49.360 Indonesian you name it whatever they
00:04:50.840 spoke all these different languages it's
00:04:52.400 going to be very difficult for you to
00:04:53.759 communicate with all of these people and
00:04:55.520 you're going to keep constantly changing
00:04:57.160 languages and mixing stuff up because
00:04:59.120 there just no one standard way to do it
00:05:01.440 whereas if they all spoke English it
00:05:03.039 would be very easy they can communicate
00:05:04.960 with each other and you can all talk
00:05:06.720 very simply that's exactly what the mCP
00:05:09.280 is attempting to do bringing this
00:05:11.280 standardized protocol to AI agents so
00:05:14.199 now all of your tool providers are going
00:05:16.320 to write code and write Services based
00:05:18.639 on this protocol so they can more easily
00:05:20.759 be kind of integrated into the AI
00:05:22.880 ecosystem and into your AI agent that's
00:05:25.560 really all it is you don't need to know
00:05:27.319 all of the details of how the protocol
00:05:29.080 works and the communication channels but
00:05:31.280 the basic idea is it's just this
00:05:32.960 standard approach that entropic has come
00:05:35.240 up with and now all of these tool
00:05:37.280 providers are racing to adhere to this
00:05:39.520 protocol so that they can be used inside
00:05:41.520 of tools like cursor for example or
00:05:43.400 inside of Claude desktop or all of these
00:05:45.400 other tools that use this protocol as
00:05:47.720 well so it's super cool you can connect
00:05:49.560 to things like databases GitHub stripe
00:05:51.520 notion memory you know all kinds of
00:05:53.319 tools are coming out every single day
00:05:55.319 and if you do care about the
00:05:56.360 architecture you can read more from the
00:05:58.120 mCP documentation and you can actually
00:06:00.199 write your own mCP servers very easily
00:06:03.360 there is two different transport
00:06:05.280 mechanisms the first is over standard
00:06:07.639 input output which just means
00:06:09.360 essentially running in your local
00:06:10.880 terminal and getting input as a command
00:06:13.240 and output as like text in the console
00:06:15.720 and then the other one is called This Ss
00:06:17.759 transport which is actually doing
00:06:19.599 communication over the network similar
00:06:21.599 to something like an HTTP rest API and
00:06:24.720 you can see that these can run locally
00:06:26.520 or remotely so for you all you really
00:06:28.759 need to know is is my mCP server running
00:06:30.720 on my own computer and is it using the
00:06:32.520 standard input output or is it running
00:06:34.720 remotely for example on someone else's
00:06:36.520 server like entropic server open AI
00:06:38.680 server or a tool provider server and
00:06:40.639 there's a different way to connect to it
00:06:42.440 based on this architecture or this
00:06:44.479 transport if that confuses you don't
00:06:46.479 worry I'm going to show you exactly how
00:06:47.759 to set up mCP servers in literally 30
00:06:49.880 seconds in just one second but you get
00:06:51.880 the idea okay so that's mCP servers
00:06:54.479 again just this standardized way of
00:06:56.280 communicating now what I want to do is
00:06:58.280 show you how we use MTP server inside of
00:07:00.960 something like cursor to just
00:07:02.479 supercharge our AI agent workflow okay
00:07:05.280 so quick cut here because I forgot to
00:07:06.759 mention this in order for everything I
00:07:08.440 show you in this video to work you need
00:07:10.199 to have cursor installed on your
00:07:11.759 computer and you need to have node.js
00:07:13.879 installed as well now you can get
00:07:16.280 node.js for free it's just called
00:07:17.960 nodejs.org so just go to that website
00:07:20.240 and go to downloads okay I'll link it in
00:07:21.800 the description and then go here where
00:07:23.599 it says pre-built node.js all right from
00:07:26.440 here select your operating system so Mac
00:07:28.639 Windows Linux okay okay make sure you
00:07:30.039 corre select the correct one so for
00:07:31.720 example if you're on the new chips do
00:07:33.000 the armm 64 if you're on Windows right
00:07:35.800 go to x86 x64 click the installer so the
00:07:40.120 windows installer or on Mac the Mac
00:07:42.039 installer run it and install node.js
00:07:44.520 once that's installed then these various
00:07:46.680 commands will work if you don't have
00:07:48.360 that you're probably going to get an
00:07:49.560 error so I just opened up cursor here
00:07:51.560 where I'm going to demo how to add an
00:07:53.199 mCP server and then start using it from
00:07:55.520 your cursor agent now this will work
00:07:57.440 inside of something like wind surf as
00:07:59.240 well and it will work in other settings
00:08:01.759 too so just because we're using this
00:08:03.400 incursor doesn't mean that mCP is
00:08:05.680 strictly forbidden to this environment
00:08:07.680 you can use mCP with kind of any type of
00:08:09.960 AI agent framework and as this becomes
00:08:12.319 more mature I think you're going to see
00:08:13.720 a lot more mCP servers and a lot more
00:08:15.759 companies adopting this protocol anyways
00:08:18.319 cursor is one of the first ones to make
00:08:20.000 this work really seamlessly so I want to
00:08:21.879 show you what it looks like and then
00:08:23.039 I'll show you how to install it so you
00:08:24.960 can see that I have three mCP servers
00:08:27.080 that I've uh kind of created here that
00:08:28.919 I've added cursor I have a fir crawl one
00:08:31.759 which allows me to scrape the web I have
00:08:33.799 a coin cap one which allows me to get
00:08:35.519 the current price of cryptocurrencies
00:08:37.599 and then I have the sequential thinking
00:08:39.120 one which allows models to think
00:08:40.679 sequentially through a problem okay a
00:08:42.760 lot of people were adding like GitHub
00:08:44.279 ones and other random ones I wanted to
00:08:46.080 do some more unique ones in the video so
00:08:47.839 that you got an idea of how to install
00:08:49.519 these from ones that were maybe smaller
00:08:51.279 mCP servers or less documented now just
00:08:53.959 to show you an example you can see in my
00:08:55.560 terminal here that I was kind of asking
00:08:57.240 some questions about my Instagram and
00:08:58.880 you can see we're actually using the mCP
00:09:01.000 tools and it will show you like what
00:09:02.800 it's actually calling the mCP tool with
00:09:04.839 so here's the query here's the limit and
00:09:06.959 then it kind of gets a result and then
00:09:08.760 same thing here for the price you can
00:09:10.279 see it said you know get crypto price it
00:09:12.399 gave the P the name of ethereum sory and
00:09:14.560 then we get back all of this data with
00:09:16.240 like the ID the name the supply the
00:09:18.440 current price and it shows me what the
00:09:20.200 price is at the current time so if you
00:09:22.839 have this agent enabled inside of cursor
00:09:25.760 then it will automatically be able to
00:09:27.160 use these mCP servers but let me show
00:09:29.240 you how we add them so I'm just going to
00:09:30.800 go ahead and delete all of these by
00:09:32.600 deleting them I can literally just
00:09:34.200 delete this entire file this mCP Json
00:09:37.040 and I'll show you how we add them so to
00:09:39.160 add them you can go to your cursor
00:09:41.040 settings so if we close this there's a
00:09:42.600 few ways to get there you can go to file
00:09:45.839 you can go to preferences and then
00:09:48.760 cursor settings or you can hit control
00:09:51.360 shift p or command shift p depending on
00:09:54.720 your operating system and you can type
00:09:57.120 cursor and then just click on cursor set
00:09:59.760 okay so open up cursor settings go to
00:10:02.760 mCP depending on your version of cursor
00:10:05.040 this might look a little bit different
00:10:06.440 and then you're going to press this
00:10:07.440 button that says add new Global mCP
00:10:09.399 server now when I press this it's going
00:10:11.120 to open up this mCP Json file however if
00:10:14.480 you don't already have this file created
00:10:16.680 it's going to ask you to create it so
00:10:18.360 just create this Json file and then
00:10:19.920 you'll be good to go now from this Json
00:10:22.120 file this is where we can add our mCP
00:10:24.399 servers and we can just put them in a
00:10:25.920 list it's very simple and I'm going to
00:10:27.880 show you how you can find mCP P servers
00:10:29.880 to then add here so I'm going to bring
00:10:32.200 up Google and what I found is this
00:10:35.200 repository I will link it in the
00:10:37.000 description which is essentially a list
00:10:39.160 of mCP servers it's just a get repo here
00:10:41.519 okay awesome mCP servers and you can
00:10:43.560 scroll through and you can kind of find
00:10:44.959 servers that do something that you want
00:10:46.680 so for example we have art and culture
00:10:48.480 we can generate images or videos we have
00:10:51.200 Cloud platforms connecting with Cloud
00:10:53.120 Player kubernetes we have command line
00:10:54.920 ones we have communication there's all
00:10:56.959 kinds of uh mCP servers I found a few
00:10:59.040 for this video that I will show you
00:11:00.560 directly and then we also have a
00:11:02.360 directory called smithery okay now
00:11:05.079 smithery is probably the most popular
00:11:06.880 one right now for finding mCP servers
00:11:09.519 but I need you to keep in mind that this
00:11:11.000 is very new so a lot of these MPC mCP
00:11:13.600 servers s either don't work or are not
00:11:15.800 really clear on how to install them so
00:11:17.720 I'm going to show you how you install
00:11:19.200 ones that aren't super super popular so
00:11:21.320 you get an idea of what's actually
00:11:22.920 happening and like you know what mCP is
00:11:25.200 and how it's functioning okay so we want
00:11:27.399 to install an mCP server so so I found
00:11:29.920 this fir crawl mCP server and the link
00:11:32.639 for this I'll put in the description on
00:11:34.279 this website called mCP doso again it's
00:11:37.040 kind of the Wild West right now we've
00:11:38.399 got mCP servers all over the place some
00:11:40.519 of them work some of them don't work
00:11:42.000 it's kind of a bit of trial and error
00:11:44.399 now from this page you can kind of read
00:11:46.320 through what you need to do here and the
00:11:48.000 first thing that I found is that I need
00:11:49.360 to create a fir crawl API key so I went
00:11:52.040 to fir crawl okay firecrow dodev I made
00:11:55.240 this API key and then I copied it okay
00:11:58.000 obviously don't link this to anyone
00:11:59.440 after the video I can regenerate this so
00:12:01.320 you guys don't see it okay I now have
00:12:03.480 this API key and then I've seen if I go
00:12:06.160 to content that is kind of giving me
00:12:08.399 some instructions on how to add this mCP
00:12:11.079 server if I scroll down here I see I
00:12:13.480 have some instructions on running on
00:12:15.240 cursor and what it says is that I need
00:12:17.320 to go to mCP servers add new mCP server
00:12:20.880 and then it tells me I need to use this
00:12:22.240 fir craw mCP and this command however
00:12:25.639 that's not what it looks like inside of
00:12:27.519 cursor for me right now I just have this
00:12:29.360 Json file like I don't have this popup
00:12:31.040 in order to add this mCP server so what
00:12:33.560 should I do well if I scroll down a
00:12:35.519 little bit I see that I get a command
00:12:37.480 that looks something like this it says
00:12:39.199 if you're using Windows and running into
00:12:40.720 issues try command SLC set fir craw API
00:12:44.399 key like this okay so I'm going to copy
00:12:47.000 this command and what I'm going to do is
00:12:49.399 go back into cursor and I'm going to
00:12:50.880 show you how to manually add this entry
00:12:53.240 so the way that this works is you write
00:12:54.800 a set of braces you write mCP servers
00:12:57.639 like that okay I'm just going to put
00:12:59.199 this in by default so that you have kind
00:13:01.440 of like a list of mCP servers then
00:13:04.120 inside of the MPC servers you write a
00:13:06.240 name for your server so in my case I'm
00:13:07.959 just going to call this far craw okay
00:13:10.560 then you put a colon then you put
00:13:13.000 another set of braces and then inside of
00:13:15.199 here you have a few different options
00:13:17.120 however you can see it's actually giving
00:13:18.440 me the auto complete because I had this
00:13:19.959 previously what you're going to do is
00:13:21.639 type command colon and then you just
00:13:24.240 paste the mCP command okay so I'm going
00:13:26.680 to paste it like that and this is what
00:13:28.519 it looks like now you'll notice that I
00:13:29.880 have an extra set of quotes so I'm just
00:13:31.360 going to remove these set of quotes
00:13:32.600 because I believe that we don't need
00:13:33.920 those and then we're going to paste our
00:13:35.600 fir craw API key right here that's
00:13:38.360 literally all that you need to do so
00:13:39.920 again I found this from the link in the
00:13:41.320 description I'll show you the command
00:13:43.399 and what's going to happen is cursor
00:13:45.279 will just automatically run this command
00:13:47.240 for you it's actually going to open a
00:13:49.120 new terminal and it's going to start
00:13:50.800 running a server that has this fir craw
00:13:53.560 mCP running okay it's running locally on
00:13:56.120 your own computer and then you're going
00:13:57.639 to be using this API key to communicate
00:13:59.880 with the fir craw servers that will then
00:14:02.079 be able to go and kind of scrape the
00:14:03.680 internet I know for any non-developers
00:14:05.519 this might look a little bit confusing
00:14:06.800 I'm just trying to explain what's going
00:14:08.040 on so that you can use some critical
00:14:09.560 thinking later to install other mCP
00:14:12.040 servers now you're going to see that
00:14:13.800 this starts with command SLC if you're
00:14:16.399 on Windows you need this okay A lot of
00:14:19.079 times it's not going to tell you to add
00:14:20.800 this command SLC but all of your
00:14:22.839 commands need to start with this if
00:14:24.720 you're on Windows if you're not on
00:14:26.839 Windows then you would remove that you
00:14:29.279 could leave the same set thing and have
00:14:31.199 this Command right here but if you're on
00:14:32.959 Windows you need this command SL C so
00:14:34.800 that it's going to run this in a
00:14:35.839 separate terminal what I'm going to do
00:14:37.800 and you can see when I run this it
00:14:39.240 actually opens up a new terminal when I
00:14:40.880 save this is it starts running this
00:14:43.000 process in the background now I'm going
00:14:44.720 to close this for right now I'm going to
00:14:46.680 go and put my fir craw API key here and
00:14:49.199 then I'm going to show you how this
00:14:50.079 works and then we'll add some other mCP
00:14:51.560 servers that will be a bit more simple
00:14:53.079 okay so I added the API key and then I
00:14:55.199 just close that Tab and you can see now
00:14:57.440 when I go back to mCP servers it shows
00:14:59.560 me fir crawl and then it says this is
00:15:01.720 the command and it shows me that it's
00:15:03.279 running now I can refresh this and when
00:15:05.399 I refresh this it will just run this
00:15:07.040 again and when it runs it we should see
00:15:09.199 that we now get a list of tools if the
00:15:11.320 command was being executed successfully
00:15:13.519 now again if you want to copy the exact
00:15:15.000 command on Windows it is this okay again
00:15:17.639 it was you know if we go back here you
00:15:18.959 can see what it looks like right here
00:15:20.519 I'm going to blur out the API key but
00:15:22.480 you guys get the idea and then on Mac
00:15:23.959 remove this command SLC same thing on
00:15:26.160 Linux and quick note if you're getting
00:15:27.920 something like client not connected just
00:15:30.120 close cursor and just reopen it okay so
00:15:32.360 I reloaded it here and you can see now
00:15:34.040 by default it's going to spin up this
00:15:35.360 terminal leave this running don't close
00:15:37.240 it and now you should see that you get
00:15:38.959 connected and you don't have that air
00:15:40.920 that's a common thing that I was
00:15:42.079 experiencing anyways now that we've got
00:15:44.120 that open what we're going to do is make
00:15:45.680 sure we go to agent mode inside of our
00:15:47.920 cursor composer and we can ask it
00:15:49.720 something like you know look up Tech
00:15:52.959 with him on Google and when we do that
00:15:55.880 it should know that it can use this fir
00:15:57.800 craw tool because it access to all of
00:15:59.800 these various tools and it will go ahead
00:16:01.759 and do that now it says no tool match
00:16:03.680 the tall mCP server fir crawl uh okay
00:16:06.839 and then it says there seems to be an
00:16:07.880 issue with the tool let me try a
00:16:08.920 different approach and then it finds
00:16:10.199 this fir craw search okay so I go ahead
00:16:12.480 and press run and then you can see what
00:16:14.839 it calls it with so you know searches
00:16:16.440 Tech with Tim limit 5 gets these URLs
00:16:19.160 and then gives me the result okay so we
00:16:21.399 can just go ahead and use that tool and
00:16:23.040 now you can use that inside of your
00:16:24.480 cursor editor which is kind of insane
00:16:26.920 let me show you how to add a few other
00:16:28.480 MC P servers so let's go here let's get
00:16:31.199 out of fir craw and let's go to Smith
00:16:34.399 and let's add the sequential thinking
00:16:37.199 one okay now it's a little bit easier
00:16:38.800 from smithery again I'll leave this link
00:16:40.839 in the description and what we can do is
00:16:42.560 just press on this cursor tab here and
00:16:44.480 notice that I've also created an account
00:16:45.959 and I've just signed into smith3 because
00:16:47.759 they're forcing you to sign in
00:16:48.959 essentially to be able to get these
00:16:50.399 install commands Okay so this page
00:16:52.040 loaded now and you can see that we have
00:16:53.399 a few different options for installation
00:16:55.519 now you can just run the commands that
00:16:57.199 it shows you right here and it should
00:16:59.040 actually just install itself inside of
00:17:01.000 cursor for you so you can see based on
00:17:03.079 the different version of cursor there's
00:17:04.319 a command that you can run so we have
00:17:05.959 this command this command this one right
00:17:07.559 here or if we want we can do the manual
00:17:09.679 installation like I showed you already
00:17:11.359 where we copy this as Json and just put
00:17:13.640 it inside of the um what do you call it
00:17:16.799 the config file okay now I'm not going
00:17:19.079 to do that because I mean we've kind of
00:17:20.520 already looked at how to manually add
00:17:21.880 this what I'm going to do though show
00:17:23.199 you how we add another more random mCP
00:17:25.599 server so for example I found this m mCP
00:17:28.559 server only has 27 Stars some random guy
00:17:31.080 made this but it does actually work and
00:17:33.480 you can see that it tells us exactly how
00:17:36.160 to get this running he has here the
00:17:37.720 config so it just says okay mongodb I
00:17:39.840 don't know why he named it mongodb but
00:17:41.320 that's what he named it has the command
00:17:42.799 npx then the arguments coin cap MCD this
00:17:45.600 one doesn't require any kind of API key
00:17:47.799 so all I'm going to do is just copy this
00:17:49.640 config again I found this from some
00:17:52.440 awesome mCP servers directory I'll link
00:17:54.520 it in the description I want to go back
00:17:56.520 to mCP servers I'm going to go add
00:17:58.159 Global mCP P server I'm going to go here
00:18:00.720 I'm going to rename this to say coin cap
00:18:04.039 like that okay and then I'm going to
00:18:07.679 close this and it says client closed
00:18:10.320 okay that's fine the reason it's not
00:18:11.919 working is because I'm on Windows and I
00:18:13.720 forgot to add the command command SLC so
00:18:16.720 what I can do is command SLC npx okay
00:18:20.360 copy that you can see now that this is
00:18:22.600 running we have it running in the
00:18:24.360 terminal and if we go back to cursor
00:18:26.280 settings nothing's showing up but we get
00:18:28.360 the tools so we can refresh this okay
00:18:30.840 all good and now you can see that this
00:18:33.000 is running and if I come here I can say
00:18:35.120 you know what is the
00:18:37.440 price of BTC and let's see if it can
00:18:41.120 look it up and give me the answer just
00:18:43.159 wait one second here ideally it should
00:18:44.840 use the tool and there you go we get the
00:18:47.200 price of Bitcoin and we can keep using
00:18:48.960 this tool you know as much as we want
00:18:50.600 and by the way if you don't want to have
00:18:52.360 to press accept on all of these like
00:18:54.280 because it's using the tool you have to
00:18:55.520 keep pressing accept if it uses multiple
00:18:57.320 tools and stuff you and if you want to
00:18:59.679 be risky go into cursor settings you can
00:19:02.200 go into features you can scroll all the
00:19:04.440 way down to YOLO mode which I think is
00:19:06.600 right here yes enable auto run mode okay
00:19:08.840 they've changed the name of it to auto
00:19:10.200 run mode but it used to be called YOLO
00:19:11.880 mode a second ago and you can enable
00:19:14.080 this and when you do that now it will
00:19:15.960 just allow the agent to call any
00:19:17.840 commands or use any of the tools that
00:19:19.720 you have now you can actually add some
00:19:22.360 stuff here so for example you can make
00:19:23.640 sure it doesn't delete any files you can
00:19:25.320 have a command deny list and an allow
00:19:27.200 list and a prompt telling it like what
00:19:29.000 it's allowed to actually be doing I
00:19:30.960 would suggest filling in these details
00:19:32.840 personally I don't run with this on but
00:19:35.039 if you want the agent to just like be
00:19:36.400 able to go and do everything and you
00:19:37.919 don't even need to watch it and it can
00:19:39.280 just call any tool that it wants and do
00:19:41.000 anything at all then of course you can
00:19:42.880 enable auto run mode all right guys
00:19:45.159 that's pretty much going to wrap it up I
00:19:46.360 know there was a lot of content there
00:19:47.480 but I wanted this to be thorough and
00:19:48.760 explain what mCP is how it works how to
00:19:50.880 set it up in cursor and how to get over
00:19:52.679 some of the issues that I personally was
00:19:54.280 facing if you want to see me build my
00:19:56.280 own custom mCP server and do it to
00:19:58.679 tutorial on that then please let me know
00:20:00.320 in the comments down below and I look
00:20:02.240 forward to seeing you in another video
